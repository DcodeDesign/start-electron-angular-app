# Introduction

Bootstrap and package your project with Angular 15 and Electron 25 (Typescript + SASS + Hot Reload) for creating Desktop applications.

Currently runs with:

- Angular v15.0.0
- Electron v25.2.0

With this sample, you can:

- Run your app in a local development environment with Electron & Hot reload
- Run your app in a production environment
- Package your app into an executable file for Linux, Windows & Mac

/!\ Hot reload only pertains to the renderer process. The main electron process is not able to be hot reloaded, only restarted.

/!\ Angular CLI & Electron Builder needs Node 18.10 or later to work correctly.

## Project structure

| Folder | Description                                      |
|--------|--------------------------------------------------|
| app    | Electron main process folder (NodeJS)            |
| src    | Electron renderer process folder (Web / Angular) |

## How to import 3rd party libraries

This sample project runs in both modes (web and electron). To make this work, **you have to import your dependencies the right way**. \

There are two kind of 3rd party libraries :
- NodeJS's one - Uses NodeJS core module (crypto, fs, util...)
    - I suggest you add this kind of 3rd party library in `dependencies` of both `app/package.json` and `package.json (root folder)` in order to make it work in both Electron's Main process (app folder) and Electron's Renderer process (src folder).

Please check `providers/electron.service.ts` to watch how conditional import of libraries has to be done when using NodeJS / 3rd party libraries in renderer context (i.e. Angular).

- Web's one (like bootstrap, material, tailwind...)
    - It have to be added in `dependencies` of `package.json  (root folder)`

## Browser mode

Maybe you only want to execute the application in the browser with hot reload? Just run `npm run ng:serve:web`.
